AXOID
=====

AXOID is an experimental general-purpose micro-framework.

It just allows to organize code as a decoupled composition of Entities.

    When you decide to not pick a public framework, 
    you will end up with a framework anyway: your own.

Pros
----

+ Declarative programming style.
+ Event driven, asynchronous, error-aware.
+ Loose coupled, dependency injection, data binding.
+ Highly extendable, true inheritance and mix-ins.
+ Best suited for full-stack solutions at both client and server side.
+ pure 100% CoffeeScript, no 3rd party dependencies.

Cons
----

+ one-man driven (but best fit my own current needs)
+ lack of documentation (but free to deep refactor)
+ no community (but no legacy support)

AXOID is also shipped with library of basic properties and predefined types.
